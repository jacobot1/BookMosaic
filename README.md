# BookMosaic
A client-side mosaic generator for a few tile images that look the same.
## Origin
I built this tool because I wanted to be able to make a photomosaic with:
1. a small number of tile images
2. all of which looked very similar
3. without editing the tile images.
## Logic
The core idea is to use a lot of small tile images in darker places on the target image and a few large tile images in brighter places. My original (incredibly niche) use case used documents as tile images, but after i built the tool, I realized that it would be perfect for making someone's portrait from the pages of a book they enjoy, hence the name.
## Usage
BookMosaic fits in a single HTML file. Download it, double-click it, and it should open in your web browser of choice.
## Contributing
BookMosaic is licensed under GPLv3, so feel free to make it better! I'd love to see any improvements you make as pull requests so I can put them back into the main app.
